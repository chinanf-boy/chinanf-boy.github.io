# Closures
[回去](toc/default.html)

---

Rust has closures. Multiple, even.

* **Advantage:** Highly optimized using only the absolutely necessary runtime resources, often none.
* **Disadvantage:** Knowing the specific closure type is not always easy.

## Notation

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/closures/1.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>
<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/closures/2.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>

## Closure-Types

FnOnce 

* The closure consumes its environment

FnMut 

* The closure mutates its environment

Fn

* The closure references its environment immutably

---

`rustc` infers the type automatically, but it is needed for type signatures!

---

The relationship between the closure types is: Fn is a supertrait FnMut, FnMut is a supertrait of FnOnce.

## Moves and Closures

As the closure environment is implicit, moving types into the closure is explicit.
