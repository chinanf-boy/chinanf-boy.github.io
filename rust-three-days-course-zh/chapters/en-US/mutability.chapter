# Mutability
[回去](toc/default.html)

---

Modern programming languages differ in their attitude towards data mutability.

Where does Rust land?

---

## An Example

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/mutability/1.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>

---

## Correct

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/mutability/2.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>

---

In Rust data mutability must be declared.

Mutability is always apparent from reading the code.

---

Mutability is fundamental to Rust and is a common consideration.

---

Mutability is a property of variables and bindings, not of the bound data!
